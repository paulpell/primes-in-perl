Just a bit code that checks if a number is prime.
Originally, it was intended to be used for project Euler, maybe it will work once.....

Use it if you find it useful once; it is very simple: one function to check if a number is prime (called isPrime).
And one that extends the list of yet known primes (this one is known as extendPrimes =D)
